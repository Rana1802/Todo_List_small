# Todo_List_small
A mini project in python about a todo list 
Description : 
Basically I have written script about Todo List. Where I have used a tasks.json file to store, update and delete tasks according to the selection. So in the code section I have just implemented different functions to load json fie i.e. tasks.json, to save tasks, to mark, update tasks etc. Now if I run this script, by selecting different numbering options I can see the tasks to do, can update it, can add task, can delete tasks. 
# Todo_List_GUI 
Here I have tried to implement a simple gui. New notebook is named as todo_gui.ipynb
